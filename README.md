# Search-Engine
This is a Python-based search engine that searches a given data corpus and returns relevant documents for a user's query. The search engine uses a combination of techniques, including text processing, indexing, and ranking, to provide accurate and efficient results.

# How it works
The search engine works in several steps:

- Data preprocessing: The data corpus is preprocessed to remove stop words, punctuation, and other irrelevant information. The text is also tokenized and stemmed to create a normalized representation of the documents.

- Indexing: The preprocessed documents are indexed using an inverted index data structure, which maps each term to the documents that contain it. This allows for fast retrieval of documents that match a user's query.

- Query processing: When a user enters a query, the search engine preprocesses it in the same way as the data corpus, and then uses the inverted index to retrieve a set of candidate documents that contain any of the query terms.

- Ranking: The candidate documents are ranked based on their relevance to the query. The ranking algorithm uses a combination of techniques, such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and cosine similarity, to determine the most relevant documents.

- Presentation: The top-ranked documents are presented to the user in a user-friendly format, along with snippets of text that match the query.

# Requirements
The search engine requires the following Python packages:

- nltk
- numpy
- pandas

# Usage
To use the search engine, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.

- Prepare your data corpus by creating a directory containing the documents you want to search. Each document should be a plain text file.

- Run the index.py script to preprocess and index the documents. This will create an inverted index file in the index directory.

- Run the search.py script and enter a query when prompted. The search engine will retrieve and rank relevant documents based on the query.
